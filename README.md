# Project : build a classifier to predict whether a loan case will be paid off or not.

@ Task - loading a historical dataset from previous loan applications, cleaning the data, and applying different classification algorithm on the data.

Analyzing the neighborhood data and building the best classifier as prediction models using the different classifications algorithms - k-Nearest Neighbour(KNN) , Decision Tree , Support Vector Machine(SVM) , Logistic Regression.

The results is reported as the accuracy of each classifier, using the following metrics when these are applicable: Jaccard index , F1-score , LogLoass.
